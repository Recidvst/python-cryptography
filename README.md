Playing around with various python hashing and encoding methods as a learning exercise.

* Decoding and then hashing an image file to then be used as a source of randomness etc.
* Pulling a random image from the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers "Unsplash API") to use in the above. 
* Encoding and decoding images in base64.
* SHA512 hashing and then poc for brute force solving a hashed password with a dictionary.
* A basic caesar cipher.
